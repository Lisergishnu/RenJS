      <description>The transitions are used everytime we show, hide or change an image. This affects how that will be achieved. There are a few usual transitions ready to use with the game: CUT, FADE, FUSION, MOVE. This are usually enought in a very classical game, but you don&amp;rsquo;t have to be limited to them. Creating transitions is really easy if you know some javascript.
All of the code concerning the transitions is inside the file RenJS/Transitions.</description>

 RenJSBootstrap: The bootstrap, it creates the game instance, loads a splash screen and kicks off the preloading process for the whole game.</description>
