      <description>One way to port the game to a native desktop application easily is by using Electron. Electron is a framework for creating native applications with web technologies like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know anything about it, don&amp;rsquo;t worry too much, here you can find the RenJS Quickstart ported to it.
The way to write your game will be the same, since the Engine doesn&amp;rsquo;t actually change, we only add Electron as a wrapper over it.</description>

      <description>For creating native mobile application we can use Cordova. Just like Electron, Cordova is a wrapper for HTML5 applications to run as native apps in mobile devices: Android, iOS and Windows Phones.
To make things easier, grab the RenJS Quickstart with Cordova, and let&amp;rsquo;s see the main differences. The biggest one is that the game is now inside the folder www. Everything inside of it is the same, you write your story as always.</description>

      <description>The easiest way to package your game is by using Cocoon. Cocoon is a cloud service, that means you don&amp;rsquo;t really need to install or do anything on your own computer, everything will be done on their servers. You just need to get an account in the Cocoon Platform, upload your code (based on this RenJS Quickstart with Cocoon), press a button to compile, and press another to download the packaged results.</description>
